# ChatBot

*A lab report by Yuxin Zhang*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**  

I made a chatbot that can tell the user which animal he or she resembles to the most among "Tiger", "Rabit", "Panda" and "Koala". The chatbot will ask the user 5 questions and based on his or her answers, it can classify the user with one out of the four animals. To make the process more interesting, the background color will be changed for each question and the chatbot will make comments to the user's responses. 

The classification is done based on the score the user get after answering all five questions. Different answers of different questions will have either positve or no effect to the score. 

Modified code is named newServer.js

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**

Rabit case: https://youtu.be/5O1XK-agNbI

For Tiger and Koala case, maybe try it yourself!
